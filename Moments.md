# Moments
- Quantitative measures of the shape of a probability density fn
- **FIRST** moment is the mean
- **SECOND** moment is the variance
- **THIRD** moment is called skew
	- how lopsided a distribution is...
		- if a longer tail or lesser slope curve is on the left of the mean, that is a **negative skew**
		- a longer tail on the right is a **positive skew**
- **FOURTH** is the kurtosis
	- kurtosis is how...
		- "thick" is the tail
		- "sharp" is the peak
			- higher the peak, the higher the kurtosis
