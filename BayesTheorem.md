THE KEY INSIGHT
- The probability of something that depends on B 
	- depends very much on the base probability of B AND A

2 vars, A && B
The Probability of A Given B, is...
- the probability of A 
- TIMES
- the probability of B given A
- OVER 
- the probability of B

P(A | B) =  ( P(A) P(B|A) ) / P(B)
